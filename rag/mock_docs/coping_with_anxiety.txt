When anxiety shows up, try placing your hand over your chest and breathing slowly. Remind yourself: This moment will pass.

Try grounding yourself by naming 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste.

It’s okay to take a break from the world. You deserve to feel safe.

The fact that you’re trying to help yourself right now already shows your strength.
