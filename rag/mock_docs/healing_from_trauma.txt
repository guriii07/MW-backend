Healing isn’t linear. Some days will feel like progress, others won’t — both are part of your journey.

You survived. That already shows your strength.

You don’t have to pretend you’re okay. It’s safe to be real here.

Your experiences are valid. You deserve support, even if you’re still trying to understand what happened.
