Even when you feel completely alone, someone in the world understands what you're going through.

Your presence matters. You have left footprints on hearts, even if you don’t see it right now.

It’s okay to reach out — connection is healing. You deserve to be seen, heard, and cared for.

You are not a burden. Your feelings are not too much. You are loved, even when it’s hard to feel it.
