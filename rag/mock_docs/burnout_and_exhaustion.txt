You are allowed to rest. Being tired doesn’t mean you’re weak — it means you’ve been strong for too long.

There is no shame in slowing down. Your value is not tied to how much you do.

Even machines need to power down. You are a human being, not a to-do list.

Pause. Breathe. The world can wait. Your wellness is important.
