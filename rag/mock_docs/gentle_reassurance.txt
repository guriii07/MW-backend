You're not alone in how you feel — and it's completely okay to have hard days. Be gentle with yourself today.

Sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is simply keep going. You're doing more than enough.

Whatever you’re facing, it’s valid. You don’t need to explain your pain to be understood.

You are deeply worthy of love and peace — not because of what you do, but because of who you are.
