You are doing your best — and that is more than enough. You are worthy of compassion, even on the days you feel low.

Forgive yourself for not being perfect. Your humanity is not a flaw — it's your beauty.

You don’t need to be “productive” to be valuable. Just being here is enough.

Speak to yourself the way you would speak to someone you love.
